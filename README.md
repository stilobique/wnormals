# INTRODUCTION

This MaxScript generates Weighted Vertex Normals for any arbitrary geometry.

It should be compatible with 3dsmax 9 and up. No dependecies on this script are
added to scene files, so it is fully compatible for other users who don't have
this script installed.

'Weighting' of vertex normals means that each face normal contribution is
scaled by a property of the triangle. This script uses the triangle surface area
and corner angle as influences. The result of this is that a small triangle will
have less influence on shading of its larger neighbor. Likewise, the neighbor
will have larger influence on the shading of the smaller neighbor.

See this illustration:

This effect is typically most visible on chamfered boxes, but enhances all types
of geometry. All geometry with proper weighted vertex normals is mathematically
guaranteed to produce more aesthetically appealing shading than the default
3dsmax generated vertex normals.

Note: Using this script on the 3dsmax teapot primitive will result in some
      artifacts, mainly at the bottom. This is not a problem with this script
      but a longstanding problem in 3dsmax. The 3dsmax teapot has degenerate
      triangles at the top and bottom poles, and thus needs some manual cleanup.

# Install
Paste the .ms file inside 3DS max Script Folder, re the script and find it on Black Sheep category.

# USAGE

1) Run the script.
2) Select one or more objects.
3) Click "Generate".
4) An Edit Normals modifier will be added to selection named "Weighted Normals".

To update the normals after changing the mesh geometry, select the object, and
click "Generate".

If you have another Edit Normals modifier with manually tweaked normals on top
of a "Weighted Normals" modifier, a new "Weighted Normals" modifier will be
added at the top of the stack. Only the topmost Edit Normals modifier can be
accessed due to a 3dsmax bug.
